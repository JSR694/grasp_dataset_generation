# Note on attributes:
#   initial_grasps: this dataset is strucutred to describe one of the initial grasps.
#   table_grasps: this dataset is structured to describe one of the table grasps.
#       Table grasps are generated by placing the grasped object on a table in a random pose,
#       and transforming initial_grasps to match the new object pose.
#    grasp_axis: the axis of this dataset which specifies a certain initial grasp.
